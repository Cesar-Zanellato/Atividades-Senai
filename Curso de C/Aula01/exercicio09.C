Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Fixing errors in program
Variable names
Integer numbers
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. Remember to find the logic errors (check the order of the months).

If you want to improve the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable names have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.

Expected output
A leap year:
Days in the first half of the current year: 182
Days in the second half of the current year: 184
Days in the current year: 366

An ordinary year:
Days in the first half of the current year: 181
Days in the second half of the current year: 184
Days in the current year: 365
